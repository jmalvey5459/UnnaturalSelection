Hello! Thank you for checking out my senior capstone project Unnatural Selection :)
I worked on a team with 3 other students at Champlain College, 2 Designers and an artist.
This is project is the combined efforts of the whole team, mixed with quite a bit of crunch due to communication issues early on in development.

If you're curious about the rest of the team's work, check out their websites here:
